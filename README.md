We're seeking to build a platform that simplifies into a extension that provides artificial-intelligence powered assistance in the (mock) interview process. Corporate america has not done enough as an industry to support kids from underprivileged backgrounds that have tried to crack it in big tech, fields full of legacy, prestige and nepotism like investment banking and private equity. This is our little contribution to helping bridge that gap. For college students, by college students. Behavioral assistance to help students understand the sort of responses expected in these corporate behavioral interviews
